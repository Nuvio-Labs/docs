# Resources

Resources are the content that you want to add to your course. They can be text or files. 

Although any file can be added to a resource, Acadea only allows for certain file types to be viewed in the browser. The following file types can be viewed in the browser:

- Microsoft Word documents (.docx, .doc)
- Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xls)
- Microsoft PowerPoint presentations (.pptx, .ppt)
- OpenOffice documents (.odt, .ods, .odp)
- Comma-separated values (.csv)
- Plain text (.txt)
- Image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff)
- Video files (.mp4, .webm, .mov, .avi, .wmv)

We hope to add support for more file types in the future.

## Adding Resources

Resources are linked to modules, so you must first add a module to your course before you can add resources to it. To add a module to your course, go to your course and click the "Settings" tab. On the Course Settings page, you can add modules to your course by clicking the "Add Module" button. You can also edit or delete modules by clicking the "Edit" button next to the module you want to edit or delete.

Once in the module you want to add resources to, click the "Add Resource" button. You will be presented with a form where you can add the resource. The form has the following fields:

- **Title**: The title of the resource. This is the title that will be displayed on the module page.
- **Type**: The type of resource. This can be either "Text" or "File".
- **Position**: The position of the resource in the module. This is the order in which the resources will be displayed on the module page.

Once you have filled out the form, click the "Add Resource" button. You will be redirected to the module page where you can see the resource you just added.

From there you can edit or update the resource by clicking the "Edit" button next to the resource you want to edit. You can also delete the resource by clicking the "Delete" button next to the resource you want to delete.

## Editing Resources

For text resources, you can edit the text by clicking the "Edit" button next to the resource you want to edit. You will be presented with a form where you can edit the text. Once you have finished editing the text, click the "Update Resource" button. You will be redirected to the module page where you can see the updated text.

For file resources, you will be presented with a dropbox where you can upload a new file. The file must be no larger than 30 MB. Once you have uploaded the file, click the "Update Resource" button. You will be redirected to the module page where you can see the updated file.

## Deleting Resources

To delete a resource, click the "Delete" button next to the resource you want to delete. You will be presented with a confirmation dialog. Click the "Delete" button to confirm the deletion. You will be redirected to the module page where you can see that the resource has been deleted.

**Please note that deleting a resource will also delete the file associated with the resource. Resource deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.**
